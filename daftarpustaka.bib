	abstract = {During this time, computer cursor operation was done by pressing and moving the mouse. So, this is less flexible for computer user that require movement in operating a computer, since to use mouse comfortably someone has to sit. Moreover, physical completeness is required for mouse operating, so that for someone who has physical disabilities feels difficult to operate it. Therefore, it is required to develop a system that provides a better comfort and flexibility not only for the healthy user computer but also for the user computer who has physical disabilities. In this final project, computer cursor operation program via voice is created. With this program, someone will have more flexibility when operating the computer cursor and also people with physical disabilities is enabled to communicate with computer. Voice recognition is a technology that is apllied in this program, with the feature extraction process used MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients) method. As for the recognitions process used artificial neural network type LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization). Voice is passed through a microphone and then it is analyzed by MFCC to produce MFCC coefficients. These coefficients are used as input vector for LVQ neural network and used as data to train the network until it has the classification capability. Programming language that is used in creating this software is Delphi programming language. Based on the result of the testing program, it is found that the success percentage rate of voice recognition with training data, that is data which is derived from databases that have been recorded and trained into the program which amounts to 240 data, is 88,89 {\%}. While in the testing with test data, that is data which is derived from the real time sayings of respondents which is amounts to 240 data, it is found that the success percentage rate of voice recognition is 83,99 {\%}},

abstract = {A Personal Identification Number (PIN) is a multiple-digit sequence widely used for user authentication. It is desirable for a PIN-entry method to be secure against two main security threats, random guessing attacks and recording attacks. Although there have been many proposals for challenge-response-based PIN-entry methods, it is well known that the only way to prevent both attacks is to physically prevent attackers from observing the challenge-response pairs, which motivates the development of PIN-entry methods that use secure secondary channels such as audio signals. To provide a guideline for designing an audio-based PIN-entry method, we propose a simple framework to transform a non-audio-based method into an audio-based one. We also present a new PIN-entry method that improves the performance of this simple transformation. Most audio-based methods in the literature are unimodal methods, that is, they transmit almost all required information through an audio channel because it was believed that this approach maximized the user's performance. In this paper, however, we show that a carefully designed bimodal system may be more usable than a unimodal one. We present a new PIN-entry method whose audio channel only transmits the minimal required data while most of the challenge information is transmitted through the efficient visual channel. Our user study shows that the PIN-entry time of the proposed method is shorter than those of the previous audio-based methods, while its error rate is kept as low as that of the previous methods.},

abstract = {Context There is a great variety of techniques for performing authentication, like the use of text passwords or smart cards. Some techniques combine others into one, which is known as multi-factor authentication. There is an interest in knowing existing authentication techniques, including those aimed at multi-factor authentication, and the frameworks that can be found in literature that are used to compare and select these techniques according to different criteria. Objective This article aims to gather the existing knowledge on authentication techniques and ways to discern the most effective ones for different contexts. Method A systematic literature review is performed in order to gather existing authentication techniques proposed in literature and ways to compare and select them in different contexts. A total of 515 single-factor and 442 multi-factor authentication techniques have been found. Furthermore, 17 articles regarding comparison and selection criteria for authentication techniques and 8 frameworks that help in such a task are discussed. Results A great variety of single-factor techniques has been found and smart card-based authentication was shown to be the most researched technique. Similarly, multi-factor techniques combine the different single-factor techniques found and the combination of text-passwords and smart cards is the most researched technique. Usability, security and costs are the most used criteria for comparing and selecting authentication schemes, whereas the context is given an important remark as well. No framework among the ones found analyzed in detail both single-factor and multi-factor authentication techniques for the decision-making process. Conclusion The review shows that a vast research has been done for authentication techniques, although its use in some contexts has not been researched as much. The lack of works regarding the comparison and selection of authentication techniques is observed.},

abstract = {— An automatic teller machine requires a user to pass an identity test before any transaction can be granted. The current method available for access control in ATM is based on smartcard. Efforts were made to conduct an interview with structured questions among the ATM users and the result proofed that a lot of problems was associated with ATM smartcard for access control. Among the problems are; it is very difficult to prevent another person from attaining and using a legitimate persons card, also conventional smartcard can be lost, duplicated, stolen or impersonated with accuracy. To address the problems, the paper proposed the use of biometric voice-based access control system in automatic teller machine. In the proposed system, access will be authorized simply by means of an enroll user speaking into a microphone attached to the automatic teller machine. There are 2 phases in implementation of the proposed system: first training phase, second testing or operational phase as discussed in section 4 of this paper.

abstract = {Designing a secure user authentication method that involves human in the authentication procedure is a challenging problem. Due to their high user convenience, the password is the most widely used means of authentication. However, passwords are vulnerability to compromise by disclosure using various forms of information tapping like Keylogging, phishing attack, human shoulder-surfing and camera-based recording. This paper starts with an analysis of a previous attempt that proposes two visual authentication protocols to enhance password authentication. These protocols were based on the use of user-driven visualization utilizing two-dimensional barcode and smartphones. Even though the two protocols resist some known types of attacks, our analysis reveals serious shortcomings. The first protocol is not secure against theft of a smartphone. Both protocols are not secure against shoulder surfing, camera-based recording and phishing attacks. In this paper, the deficiencies of the original scheme are demonstrated, then a two-factor authentication scheme that eliminates these deficiencies is presented. A prototype of the proposed scheme is implemented and a secured virtual on-screen keyboard (SVOSK) comprising dynamic emoticon keyboard layout is also proposed. Formal security proof and usability analyses show that the proposed scheme is secure, efficient and has a high level of usability.},

abstract = {Smart city is a development tendency of future city, which improves almost all aspects of quality of urban residents' life by adopting Information and Communication Technology. In smart city, people can interact directly with the community and the infrastructure at anytime and anywhere, where GLObal MObility NETwork (GLOMONET) is an important network infrastructure for smart city. Recently, Gope and Hwang proposed an efficient authentication scheme for GLOMONET. However, we find their scheme lacks session key update and wrong password detection mechanisms, and vulnerable to denial-of-service attack. Besides, the session key can be known by HA (home agent), and perfect forward secrecy cannot be ensured. Furthermore, in their scheme, HA has to take heavy secret key management work. Based on previous work, this paper first summarizes the security and function requirements of authentication for GLOMONET in smart city environment. Later, this paper proposed a robust biometrics based three-factor authentication scheme for GLOMONET in smart city. Security features of the proposed scheme are analyzed in detail, and comparisons of our scheme with other related schemes are illustrated. Analysis and comparison results show that our scheme meets the preconcerted security requirements of authentication for GLOMONET in smart city environment, and it is robust for GLOMONET in smart city environments with higher security requirements.},
